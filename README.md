# dc-adminmenu

An improved version of qb-adminmenu. With better logic and more features.
As always more features planned. Pull requests are welcome as well.

# Installation
Add `exec resources\[qb]\dc-adminmenu\permissions.cfg` to your `server.cfg` file. Or `exec <path name here>\permissions.cfg` if you have a custom path.
Please read the permissions.cfg carefully and afterwards add your own permissions e.g. `add_principal identifier.fivem:1070255 AdminmenuGod`.
If you do however have a different naming scheme or custom path names do change them accordingly and update all the functions accordingly.

## I get kicked while using the command /admin?
Make sure you added yourself as an admin or god. When using the deployable QBCore setup the only thing left for you to do is change your ace to `qbcore.god` from whatever it puts there first. This could be `group.admin` or `group.god`. (AS IT STATES IN YOUR SERVER.CFG [HERE](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/txAdminRecipe/blob/642d295fc74e39e5edeef3d5bee01555b9d8d963/server.cfg#L102)). Using the old permission system? Join your server once and the core will print your license in the server console which you need to add to your database.
